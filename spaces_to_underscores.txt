TERMS

GNU               GNU is a repetitive acronym. Meaning, one
                  can expand it again and again. So, one gets:
                  Gnu is Not Unix is Not Unix ...

SYSTEM_INFORMATION

The practical examples in the video were executed on a
CentOS machine:

$ cat /etc/redhat-release
CentOS Linux release 7.5.1804 (Core)

Since the functionality depends on GNU software, like bash,
[find_utils], sed and the coreutils, the commands run
on other Linux distributions in a similar way.


DOWNLOAD_SCRIPT

From the github.com webinterface you can download a zip file
of the repository that includes the
mk_dirtree_with_spaces.sh script. The clickpath is:

- https://github.com/aberends/spaces_to_underscores
- Left mouse button click on "Clone or Download"
- Left mouse button click on "Download ZIP"
- Now save the file (exactly how depends on the browser)

Firefox saves the zip-file in ~/Downloads. So we unpack it
there:

$ cd ~/Downloads
$ unzip spaces_to_underscores-master.zip
$ cd spaces_to_underscores-master
$ ls 

To be able to download the mk_dirtree_with_spaces.sh script,
one needs to have the git command. On CentOS we install it
with:

# yum -y install git

In order to use the tree command, we need:

# yum -y install tree

Now, under a normal (i.e. non-root) user, we clone the git
repository with:

$ git clone https://github.com/aberends/spaces_to_underscores.git
$ cd spaces_to_underscores
$ ./mk_dirtree_with_spaces.sh
$ tree top
